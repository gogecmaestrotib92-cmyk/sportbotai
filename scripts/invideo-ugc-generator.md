## 💡 Pro Tips for Better Results

### Voiceover Guidance
- Use conversational tone, not salesy
- Pause after key phrases
- Emphasize: "60 seconds", "AI", "no BS", "free"
- Keep energy consistent

### Visual Pacing
- First 3 seconds = hook (must grab attention)
- Show app by second 10
- Keep each cut 2-5 seconds max
- End with clear CTA

### A/B Testing Ideas
- Test different hooks (problem vs curiosity vs social proof)
- Test with/without face (some UGC is just screen recording + voiceover)
- Test different CTAs: "Link in bio" vs "Try free" vs "Swipe up"

---

## 📊 Tracking & Iteration

### What to Test
- [ ] Hook variations (first 3 seconds)
- [ ] App feature focus (analyzer vs AI chat vs market edge)
- [ ] Video length (15s vs 30s vs 45s)
- [ ] CTA placement (end only vs throughout)

### Success Metrics
- Hook rate (3-second views / impressions)
- Hold rate (average watch time)

- Cost per install (CPI)
